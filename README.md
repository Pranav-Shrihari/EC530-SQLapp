Once you're in the right directory, you need to set up an API key variable that you can use. You can use the following command in the terminal:
<pre lang="python"> export OPENAI_API_KEY= 'your-api-key-here' ## Replace this with the API key </pre>
After you define this variable, you can run the application by typing the following in the terminal:
